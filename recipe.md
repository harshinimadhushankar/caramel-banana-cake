Grease 9x13 cake tin with butter/oil and Preheat the oven at 170 degrees
Cut 2/3 bananas, depending on the cake size and Place the sliced bananas on the base of the tin.
Get 12 tablespoons of butter and 1 and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and place them in a saucepan above a stove with medium heat. Melt until no chunks of butter and suggar are left.
Pour the mixture over the sliced bananas in the cake tin. Set Aside
Next, mix together the mashed banana, melted butter, eggs, greek yogurt, sugar, and vanilla extract until combined. Stir in the baking powder and salt, then stir in the flour, mixing until just combined.
Spread the batter evenly on top of the bananas, and bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the top has started to turn golden brown along the edges and the brown sugar and butter bubbles up along the rim of the pan.
Cool for 10 mins and enjoy!!
